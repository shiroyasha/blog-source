Hi there! My name is Igor Šarčević. I have held the position of Chief Architect
at SemaphoreCI for almost a decade, where I was focusing on increasing developer
productivity and helping close to 50,000 organizations achieve operational
excellence.

In 2023, I decided to pursue my entrepreneurial dreams and founded a startup
focusing on operational excellence.

Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in software design and development,
and have always been passionate about creating innovative solutions that can
improve people's lives. My extensive experience in the field, combined with my
love for entrepreneurship and problem-solving, has led me to my current venture,
where I am working tirelessly to bring my ideas to life.

Through this blog, I hope to share my journey as a software architect turned
entrepreneur, and offer insights and advice to others who are interested in
pursuing a similar path. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting
out, I hope that you'll find my experiences and perspectives to be valuable
and informative.
