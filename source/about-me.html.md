I'm Igor Šarčević. I live in Novi Sad, Serbia, with my girlfriend, a cat, and a
bunch of computers. I work at <a href="https://semaphoreci.com" target=_blank>Semaphore</a>, a
cloud-based continuous integration and deployment tool.

My expertise is in software development, primarily in developing web apps.
For almost a decade (since 2012), I've been developing software
professionally. In the last two years, I'm focusing on software architecture.
At Semaphore, I'm running architecture and algorithm design.

I have several strong opinions about development:

- An asynchronous workplace is the best place to develop software.
- I prefer long-form, written communication, over chat, or meetings.
- There are no 10x developers, but there are 10x work environments

My main programming languages are Golang and Elixir. I'm reasonably well-versed
in JavaScript and Ruby as well.

## List of fun facts

- I speak four languages: English, Serbian, Hungarian, and Japanese.
- Chess is my favorite game. I consider myself a "pretty good" player.
- I have practiced martial arts for 24 years so far. I'm a black belt ninja.
- Running and Hiking are my primary choice of recreation. There is a good chance
  that I will be on top of a mountain during the weekend.

## How can you contact me?

I enjoy dark, locally brewed beer. If you are in Novi Sad, feel free to invite
me to one of our local places for a pint or two.
