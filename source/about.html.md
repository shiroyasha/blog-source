Hi there!

Welcome to my personal blog, a space where I like to share updates, tips,
tricks, and events I take place in.

My name is Igor, but many people know me by my handle @shiroyasha. I'm a
software engineer, working at [Rendered Text](http://renderedtext.com),
the company that creates [SemaphoreCI](https://semaphoreci.com), the leading
continuous delivery platform focused on speed and simplicity.

I enjoy everything that is connected to shipping and maintaining a great
product. Writing code, setting up the infrastructure, promoting the product,
giving technical talks, drawing, writing, teaching, doing customer support... I
enjoy every part and every role.

## Skills

I am most skilled with writing Rails based software by following BDD principles,
but I have developed solid skills in other areas as well. Instead of sharing a
list of technologies, I'll share the list of major features that I implemented
on Semaphore.

- The first major feature I shipped was the introduction of
  [interactive SSH sessions](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/2015/02/04/ssh-access-to-your-ci-environment.html)
  into our build machines. From the UI, through virtual machines,
  down to firewall settings.

- Software that orchestrates virtual machines. Starting, stopping, and preparing
  clean build environments for every CI job executed on Semaphore.

- I was part of a small team that wrote our first microservice 3 years ago. The
  start of our effort to break our monolith into small, dedicated components.

- I laid the foundations of our AWS infrastructure,
  [introducing Docker](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/2016/12/13/lightweight-docker-images-in-5-steps.html)
  as our primary software delivery mechanism. This infrastructure has ever since
  supported our rapid microservice growth without any bottleneck. In the process
  we created [Alpine Release](https://github.com/renderedtext/alpine-release),
  our standard Elixir packaging tool.

- Introduced RabbitMQ as our official service communication channel. Creating
  [Tackle](https://github.com/renderedtext/tackle) and
  [ExTackle](https://github.com/renderedtext/ex-tackle) along the way.

- Wrote 2 out of the [10 most popular technical articles](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/top-10-semaphore-community-tutorials-in-2016)
  on Semaphore's community. Both articles tackle the issue of continuously
  testing your JavaScript applications.

- Last year, I lead the team that completely rewrote our
  [Build and Deploy scheduler](http://semaphoreci.com/docs/how-semaphore-scheduler-works.html),
  a piece of software that is responsible creating, scheduling,
  assigning build machines, and collecting results of every CI job that is
  created on Semaphore. A rewrite that allowed us support for 10x higher job
  throughput, and single builds that could be parallelized across more than 100
  build machines.

## Personal Life

I was raised in a small town in Serbia, but I didn't know Serbian until I
turned eight years old. Until then I only spoke my mother thong &mdash;
Hungarian. Raised in dual language environment sparked my love for languages,
and currently I speak four: English, Hungarian, Serbian and Japanese.

Japanese is probably the most outstanding on the list, a language which I
started learning while watching anime and reading manga, but continued with
dedicated Japanese classes at the first year of university.

I always enjoyed doing martial arts. It is the best way to learn discipline and
to gain the necessary mental toughness to handle hard kicks that life can
sometimes serve you. I was involved with some kind of martial arts from when I
was only five years old, but I only took martial arts more seriously when I
turned twenty.

I started with karate, but I slowly transitioned to
[Ninjutsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bujinkan), and tried out various others
like [Kendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendo) and
[Aikido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido).

Besides martial arts, I also enjoy hiking, jogging and swimming.

## How can you contact me?

I enjoy dark, locally brewed beer. If you are from Novi Sad feel free to invite
me to one of our local places for a pint or two.
