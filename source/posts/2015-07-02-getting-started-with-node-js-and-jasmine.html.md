It's a shame that, almost since its creation, JavaScript had been considered
more of a quick hack than an actual programming language. Lacking the tools and
the community that other popular languages had, for a long time it was a
language that many people enjoyed to hate. Fortunately, with the inception of
Node.js, JavaScript got a chance to shine with an awesome community and the
toolset it always deserved.
