Over the last fifteen years, SSH has become a standard tool for remote
management of Unix-like systems and many network devices. SSH stands for Secure
Shell, and is one of the ways to get a command line (shell) access on a remote
machine. It was designed to be a secure alternative to previous access methods
such as telnet.
