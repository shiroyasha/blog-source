Every three months, I like to sit down, zoom out from daily issues, and
try concentrate on the big picture. I like to write down the things I want to
achieve in the next three months, and to write a retrospect of the goals I
set myself in the previous session. The three month schedule is ideal, as it is
not too long so that I lose focus, nor it is too short for it to feel daunting
and boring.

I started this practice 2 years ago, and it helped me immensely so far. From
getting better at my job to losing weight and returning to practice martial
arts.

A part of this schedule is my New Year's resolution, where I try to focus on the
most basic things, changes that would have the biggest impact on my life. These
are usually the hardest to implement, and usually require a change in my
lifestyle and perspective on life.

This year, I wrote down two things, and one of them is to improve the quality of
my sleep.

## Why is better sleep important?

I never had a good sleep etiquette. Even when I was really young, I was usually
up till 12 watching cartoons or doing my homework. This was not such a big issue
when I was younger because I could usually sleep in every morning.

However, as I got older this balance was ruined. I had to realize the sad truth
that this world is optimized for early birds &mdash; people who can wake up
before 7am and be full of energy.

I hit the bottom last year. I waked up at 8am every morning, and got back from
working out at 11pm just to binge watch YouTube till 1:30am. Sleeping less than
7 hours on average per day.

This had a lot of consequences on my life:

- Constant migraines and irritability
- A crappy attitude toward life, friends, and colleagues
- Degraded work and fitness performance
- Total dependence on caffeine to keep myself productive
- Binge sleeping on weekends to regain sanity

To many people, this doesn't sound like a big issue. "Just go to sleep earlier"
they say. Unfortunately, this is not so simple. Even if I go to sleep earlier,
most of the time I will just lay in the bed, turning around, failing to fall
asleep. Or even if I fall asleep earlier, lets say 11am, I will just wake up at
4am, and fall asleep again at 5am.

I must find the root cause of the issue.

## The vicious cycle of no sleep and caffeine addiction

I spend most of my Sundays resting and staying in the bed longer than usual.
Which in turn makes me not sleepy even at 2am on Monday, and then my alarm wakes
me up at 8am. Then, I spend most of day craving for sleep, and I end up drinking
4 to 5 cups of coffee on Monday.

The overconsumption of coffee makes me too hyper to fall asleep again, and I
repeat the same thing on Tuesdays. Even more tired, drinking even more coffee.

On Wednesday my system collapses, my head hurts, and my productivity plummets. I
go to sleep at 7pm and wake up around 2am, making my sleep cycle even more out
of balance.

Due to lack of sleep, my anxiety grows, that again prevents me to sleep well. I
end up skipping the gym because I am too tired. Which makes my anxiety worse,
which makes my sleep worse... And this vicious cycle continues, week by week,
month by month.

At the end of the week, I always make up the lost sleep time somehow, but it
took me too long to realize that I have an issue with sleep and that I need to
invest concious effort to improve this part of my life.

## How I plan to tackle this issue?

To be honest, I already started working on this issue in December, and I can
already feel the positive effects. My focus has improved, and I already feel
that I have more positive energy during the day.

Here is my action plan:

#### 1. Tracking sleep quality

The only proven way in which I can improve something in my life is to track,
measure and retrospect. So I started with tracked my sleep quality. A simple
style sheet where I write down when I went to sleep, and when did I wake up.

By doing this, I can experiment with various approaches, and find the most
optimal solution.

#### 2. Tracking caffeine consumption

Luckily, I have been tracking my calorie intake in the last two years, so I
have a pretty good metric that I can rely on:

My plan is to reduce my caffeine intake to around 100mg per day. This should
allow me to drink one cup of coffee per day, or two cups of green tea per day.

My research on the internet tells me that a cup of coffee has an effect on my
body for around six hours. This made me limit the period of caffeine
consumption. I started only drinking coffee in the morning. In the afternoon I
only drink hibiscus or camomile tea.

#### 3. Making a better sleep ritual

I usually keep my phone/tablet near my bed and I fall asleep by browsing,
reading, and watching YouTube. This can keep me up for hours.

Instead of this, I started to prepare for bed by doing some basic stretches,
drinking a cup of camomile tea, and instead of internet I try to read a book.

I found this practice very rewarding. The stretches relax my muscles, the tea
relaxes nerves, and a book makes me fall asleep much faster then a YouTube
video.

#### 4. Waking up without an alarm clock

I have a very lucky position that I work in an industry where flexible work
hours are the norm. There is absolutely no need to force myself to wake up at
8am. No one will appreciate it if I come to work at 8:30am with baggy eyes,
groggy, unproductive, and resonating with an unpleasant "leave me alone" aura.

From this perspective, it is probably even better to show up around 11am
with a big smile, full of energy, positive vibes, and ready to make a dent in
the universe

From my estimates, I think I can wake up naturally without an alarm around
9am. So I decided to set my alarm clock to 10am. This will hopefully enable me
possible to wake up without it, but I will still have a safety net to avoid
sleeping till noon.

#### 5. Making sleep a priority

The biggest change I have to do is to recognize the importance of sleep. That
means that I'll try to avoid programming after 11am, to avoid Facebook chatting
till 2am, going to a jog at 11pm, things that I have regularly done last year.

## Final words

Sleep was always one of the major issues in my life, that often prevented me to
fully enjoy my days. Hopefully, by making a concious effort to improve it, I
will improve not only my health and social life, but also my work productivity.

This is my first attempt ever to improve my sleep ritual. I'll probably make a
lot of mistakes during the way. If you have any good tips or tricks, or if you
have a similar issue please leave a comment in the comment section bellow. Any
help will be very appreciated.

Cheers for a good night of sleep!
