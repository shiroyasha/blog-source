Every three months, I like to sit down, zoom out from daily issues, and
try concentrate on the big picture. I like to write down the things I want to
achieve in the next three months, and to write a retrospect of the goals I
set myself in the previous session. The three month schedule is ideal, as it is
not too long so that I lose focus, nor it is too short for it to feel daunting
and boring.

I started this practice 2 years ago, and it helped me immensely so far. From
getting better at my job to losing weight and returning to practice martial
arts.

A part of this schedule is my New Year's resolution, where I try to focus on the
most basic things, changes that would have the biggest impact on my life. These
are usually the hardest to implement, and usually require a change in my
lifestyle and perspective on life.

This year, I wrote down two things, and one of them is to improve the quality of
my sleep.

## Why is better sleep important?

I never had a good sleep etiquette. Even when I was really young, I was usually
up till 12 watching cartoons or doing my homework. This was not such a big issue
when I was younger because I could usually sleep in every morning.

However, as I got older this balance was ruined. I had to realize the sad truth
that this world is optimized for early birds &mdash; people who can wake up
before 7am and be full of energy.

I hit the bottom last year. I waked up at 8am every morning, and got back from
working out at 11pm just to binge watch YouTube till 1:30am. Sleeping less than
7 hours on average per day.

This had a lot of consequences on my life:

- Constant migraines and irritability
- A crappy attitude toward life, friends, and colleagues
- Degraded work and fitness performance
- Total dependence on caffeine to keep myself productive
- Binge sleeping on weekends to regain sanity

To many people, this doesn't sound like a big issue. "Just go to sleep earlier"
they say. Unfortunately, this is not so simple. Even if I go to sleep earlier,
most of the time I will just lay in the bed, turning around, failing to fall
asleep. Or even if I fall asleep earlier, lets say 11am, I will just wake up at
4am, and fall asleep again at 5am.

I must find the root cause of the issue.

## The vicious cycle of no sleep and caffeine addiction

I spend most of my Sundays resting and staying in the bed longer than usual.
Which in turn makes me not sleepy even at 2am on Monday, and then my alarm wakes
me up at 8am. Then, I spend most of day craving for sleep, and I end up drinking
3-4 cups of coffee on Monday.

The overconsumption of coffee makes me too hyper to fall asleep again, and I
repeat the same thing on Tuesdays. Even more tired, drinking even more coffee.

On Wednesday my system collapses, my head hurts, and my productivity plummets. I
go to sleep at 7pm and wake up around 2am, making my sleep cycle even more out
of balance.

Due to lack of sleep, my anxiety grows, that again prevents me to sleep well. I
end up skipping the gym because I am too tired. Which makes my anxiety worse,
which makes my sleep worse... And this vicious cycle continues, week by week,
month by month.

At the end of the week, I always make up the lost sleep time somehow, but it
took me too long to realize that I have an issue with sleep and that I need to
invest concious effort to improve this part of my life.
