Every three months, I like to sit down, zoom out from daily issues, and
try concentrate on the big picture. I like to write down the things I want to
achieve in the next three months, and to write a retrospect of the goals I
set myself in the previous session. The three month schedule is ideal, as it is
not too long so that I lose focus, nor it is too short for it to feel daunting
and boring.

I started this practice 2 years ago, and it helped me immensely so far. From
getting better at my job to losing weight and returning to practice martial
arts.

A part of this schedule is my New Year's resolution, where I try to focus on the
most basic things, changes that would have the biggest impact on my life. These
are usually the hardest to implement, and usually require a change in my
lifestyle and perspective on life.

This year, I wrote down two things, and one of them is to improve the quality of
my sleep.

## Why is better sleep important?

I never had a good sleep etiquette. Even when I was really young, I was usually
up till 12 watching cartoons or doing my homework. This was not such a big issue
when I was younger because I could usually sleep in every morning.

However, as I got older this balance was ruined. I had to realize the sad truth
that this world is optimized for early birds, people who can wake up before 7am
and be full of energy.

I hit the bottom last year. I waked up at 8am every morning, and got back from
working out at 11pm just to binge watch YouTube till 1:30am. Sleeping less than
7 hours on average per day.

This had a lot of consequences on my life:

- Constant migraines and irritability
- A crappy attitude toward life, friends, and colleagues
- Degraded work and fitness performance
- Total dependence on caffeine to keep myself productive
- Binge sleeping on weekends to regain sanity
