Ruby is not the fastest language, nor is it the simplest language, but damn it,
it is definitely one of the most fun languages. For someone like me, who enjoys
programming maybe a bit too much, a language that puts little or no limitations
on the things I can tweak feels very natural and an obvious first choice when it
comes to solving complex issues.

I measure the quality of a programming language by the amount of frustration I
feel while I write software. For example, Lisp like languages frustrate me right
of the bat when I write my first bracket. In Haskell, I can't stand the
abbreviations in the prelude, and don't get me even started about Python.

Of course, there are many things I don't like in Ruby too. However, the language
is designed in a way that it is easy to mold, improve, and make a DSL that is
an awesome fit for the issues in a domain I want to solve.
