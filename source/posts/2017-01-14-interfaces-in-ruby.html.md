Ruby is not the fastest language, nor is it the simplest language, but damn it,
it is definitely one of the most fun languages. For someone like me, who enjoys
programming maybe a bit too much, a language that puts little or no limitations
on the things I can tweak feels very natural and an obvious first choice when it
comes to solving complex issues.
