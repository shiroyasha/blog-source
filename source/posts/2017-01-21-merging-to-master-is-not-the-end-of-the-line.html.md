After weeks of planing, painful debugging sessions, and making sure that
everything is covered with tests, your feature branch turns green and you are
ready to merge into master and deploy to production. You hit the "Merge" button
on GitHub, open your CI service and watch how master turns green.
Automatically, deployment to production is triggered, and after several minutes
your new feature goes live.

Woohoo! You have done a great job. Time to open your a bottle of the finest
whiskey in the office and celebrate with your team. You are now ready to tackle
new challenges! Not so fast! Writing good code and deploying to production is
not the end of the game, you have only done half of the job.
