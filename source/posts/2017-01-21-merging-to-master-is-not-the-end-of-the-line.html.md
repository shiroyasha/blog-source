After weeks of planing, painful debugging sessions, and making sure that
everything is covered with tests, your feature branch turns green and you are
ready to merge into master and deploy to production. You hit the "Merge" button
on GitHub, open your CI service and watch how master turns green.
Automatically, deployment to production is triggered, and after several minutes
your new feature goes live.

Woohoo! You have done a great job. Time to open your a bottle of the finest
whiskey in the office and celebrate with your team. You are now ready to tackle
new challenges! Not so fast! Writing good code and deploying to production is
not the end of the game, you have only done half of the job.

Think about it. What is your job? To write good code that produces zero bugs, or
to make a useful new feature that will improve the lives of your users?
Hopefully, you choose the second answer.

If you share my beliefs, a good programmer should always aim to make someone's
life better. You must make sure that you not only write good code, but to make
that code easily and instantly usable. In rare occasions, it is even better to
simply remove the new feature if you have not met your users expectation.

## Test running your new feature

## Setting up metrics and alerts

## Announcing the new feature

## Communicating with the users

## Improving the feature

## Removing the feature (if necessary)

## Opening the bottle of the finest whisky
