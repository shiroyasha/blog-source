My Rails app used to be fast and snappy, and everything was working just fine
for several months. Then, slowly, as my product grew and users started to flock
in, web requests become slow and my database’s CPU usage started hitting the
roof. I hadn’t changed anything, why was my app getting slower?

Is there any cure for the issues I’m having with my application, or is Rails
simply not able to scale?
