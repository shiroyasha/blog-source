Mentoring younger developers is a very rewarding experience. It challenges your
your pre-established ways of thinking, and it forces you to re-evaluate your
long held principles. For example, a simple question like "Why does it matter
to DRY out your code?" is remarkably hard to answer.

In the last couple of years, I was asked to provide tips and guidance on how to
become a better software engineer. Sadly, I rarely gave a satisfying answer. It
is hard to come up with a good advice on the spot.

This article is an attempt to systematically prepare and share a set of
principles that helped me to become a better engineer. Obviously, there are as
many learning styles as there are people, but these are what work for me.

I identified five principles that are the fundamentals of my learning style.

### 1. Start with a real problem, not with solutions

I am sure that there are people out there who can simply learn just for the sake
of intellectual curiosity. But that is not how it works for me. I need to have
a real reason for learning something.

For example, learning the actor model because my friend told me its an
interesting approach for structuring programs won't really keep my attention
span too long. I might learn the basics, but I will soon hop on to the next
thing that grabs my curiosity.

Instead of learning a technology, I find it much easier to learn as I was on a
mission to fix something. For example, if I notice that I create lots of
concurrency related bugs in my code, I go on a mission to figure out a way to
improve this process and I explore the actor model as one of the possible
solutions.

Starting with a problem that directly a real human helps me in three ways.

1. I have a strong motivation for learning, which keeps my focus in place.

2. I don't keep learning every small, potentially insignificant details, of
the solution space. For example, the mathematical model behind the actor model
is perhaps interesting, but it doesn't bring me closer to anything in real in
life.

3. When I find a solution, a real human being's life gets better.

### 2. Focus on the 80 percent, explore the 20 percent

Perfection is useless. Focus on the core 80 percent of the problem.

1. When learning, learn the core of the idea. You will learn the rest when you
   really need it.

2. When designing a solution, resolve the 80 percent of the edge cases.
   Striving for 100 percent, usually makes the design too complex.

3. Strive to be an engineer that is not a "bug fixer". Fixing bugs is an
   important skill to have, but your fisolving the core of the problem

### 3. There are no problems out of your league

I observed two detrimental patterns in our industry:

1. The "I'm an not smart enough to know that many things" pattern, where a
   frontend engineer refuses to learn any backend code, or an engineer doesn't
   know how compile his code and ship it as a Docker container.

2. The "I'm am too good to learn about those insignificant details" pattern,
   where an experienced engineer refuses to tackle some issues because he thinks
   he is too good for it. For example, fixing a CSS bug is not worthy of my
   time, even if all of our customers are suffering to use our product.

You are not less or more capable than anyone else.

If you are good with SQL, but not with docker, you will always depend on someone
else to completely ship a great product. Don't put virtual limitations on
yourself. You are capable of learning anything and everything.

Many times, even a 20 percent of the full knowledge from some other area can
allow you to do things 10x faster.

### 4. Always keep improving your basics

It's a sad thing when a software engineer doesn't know how to use `grep` to find
a pattern recursively in a directory. Or when you don't know how to follow TDD
principles. Or when you struggle with the shortcuts in your editor of choice.

The basics are basics for a reason. Once you learn them, they can improve your
while life for the better for the long run.

Dedicate at least a portion of your time every week to keep your basics in good
condition. If you have struggled with `awk` last week, for example, make sure to
read up a bit of from the manual page this week.

### 5. Read a shit-ton of code
