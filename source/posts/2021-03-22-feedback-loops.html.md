A framework that enables us to experiment often, act fast,
and to make <br>high-quality decisions independently.

## Background: Why we need feedback loops?

On any reasonably sized project, you need to have a team of highly qualified
people to help you build it. You need two ingredients for this. First, you need
to gather a group of qualified individuals. Then, you need to provide an
environment where they can thrive.

Individuals + Good Communication = Team


"Feedback loops" are a set of processes that we use at Semaphore

Explain the core problem.
How do feedback loops solve this problem?

What do I mean when I say feedback loops.
Metrics, Weekly Analysis, and testing out hypothesis.

How to set up your first feedback loop in the company?
Start small, be programmatic, measure things that have the biggest impact.

Feedback loops at Semaphore.
What did we learn? What could we do better?

Feedback loop Anti-Patterns.
The team that sets up the feedback loop, is not the one who runs it.

Explain types of feedback loops.

- Feedback loops that aim to make a breakthrough.
- Feedback loops that keep a system stable.
- Feedback loops that break aim to stop a crumbling system.
