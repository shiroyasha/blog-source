A framework that enables us to experiment often, act fast,
and to make <br>high-quality decisions independently.

There is a surprising effect in nature where a tree or bush will suddenly ripen
all of its fruit or vegetables, without any visible signal. If we look at an
apple tree, with many apples, seemingly overnight they all go from unripe to
ripe to overripe.

This will begin with the first apple to ripen. Once ripe, it gives off a gas
known as ethylene (C2H4) through its skin. When exposed to this gas, the apples
near to it also ripen. Once ripe, they too produce ethylene, which continues to
ripen the rest of the tree in an effect much like a wave.

If you have an unripe avocado or other fruits at home, try putting them in a
paper bag with a ripening banana. This will speed up the ripening of the avocado
because ethylene emitted by the ripening banana will trigger the climacteric
response in the avocado. This strategy works best when the ripening fruit is one
that emits a high concentration of ethylene, such as an apple, pear, banana,
or passion fruit.

This feedback loop is often used in fruit production, with apples being exposed
to manufactured ethylene gas to make them ripen faster.

## The power of the feedback loop

Here is a fact: Most teams, most of the times, don't know where they are stand
on projects that are important to them.

Software teams want to increase software stability, but they don't collect bug
reports from their systems. Engineers want to make their software faster, but
they don't have a baseline of the current performance, nor a target they want to
reach. Companies want to have more customers, but they don't track signups, nor
do they analyze the failed ones.

My take is that we should play an active role in the feedback loops that shape
our products.

Companies that fail to self-examine tend to few lucky successes and many
invisible failures. These failures that are left untreated tend to anchor them
down, and keep them spiraling in a downright trend.

Hopefully, the reverse is also true. Companies that carefully design and
monitor their feedback loops recognize and monitor the threats, and act on
opportunities faster.

## Designing your feedback loops

On any reasonably sized project, you need to have a team of highly qualified
people to help you build it. You need two ingredients for this. First, you need
to gather a group of qualified individuals. Then, you need to provide an
environment where they can thrive.

Software engineering teams have been inspired by many disciplines. Some model
their environment that resembles a military-like chain of command, where
discipline and precision are key. Other teams are inspired by craftsman, where
creativity and dedication to the craft are the prime virtues.

In this article, we will be primarily inspired by the core principles of
science.

These principles are:

1. _Build Hypothesis: We build our software by building hypothesis._
2. _Measure: We measure our outcomes, trying to be as objective as possible._
3. _Analyze: We analyze the metrics, learn, and build new hypothesis._
