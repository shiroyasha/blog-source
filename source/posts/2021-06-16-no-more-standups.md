# No more standups

At Semaphore, all of our engineering teams were practicing daily standups to
coordinate work and to stay in touch with the rest of the team. Standups were
a core practice that we did since the early days of the company.

Last year we changed this. Now, we have one meeting per week instead.

We become a fully remote company four years ago. Since than, we have become
very good at async communication. Every major announcement is published on
Basecamp, all the bugs/tasks are tracked and discussed via GitHub issues, while
the day-to-day communication and problem solving is done via Slack.

And yet, even with a very healthy communication channels, we still spent 15 to
30 minutes per day discussing status updates and blockers. Add to this 15
minutes of before and after buffer periods to get-out and get back in a deep
focus mode, and you get a one-hour long deep thinking disturbance every day.

Here are some other issues that I have with traditional standups:

- They discourage deep problem solving, in favor of short and consumable status
  updates. Status updates are important, but they will never more the business
  forward.

- They either don't include people who can help you to get unblocked, or they
  include way too many people who are working on completely unrelated problems.
  The perfect balance is hard to achieve regularly.

- They are very good at creating busywork, and scheduling more meetings for the
  day.
