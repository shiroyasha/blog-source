I've recently shared a post on X about the asking questions and the importance 
of it in a company culture. Here they are:

> The temporary discomfort of asking questions is nothing compared to the
> permanent cost of not asking them. The biggest red flag in any workplace? When
> people stop asking questions. 
> 
> Risk to be stupid for 5 minutes. Learn. Repeat.

Let me expand on this a bit more.

There's a dangerous illusion plaguing most workplaces today. We've convinced
ourselves that looking smart is more important than getting things right. We
reward confidence over curiosity. We promote people who have answers, any 
answers, rather than those who ask essential questions and actually solve 
problems.

The cost of silence is high. It's not just the cost of mistakes that could 
have been avoided. Europe is great example. A continent of experts. We have 
experts in everything. From our government to our companies. Nothing gets 
done. Everyone is virtuous. No one is willing to ask questions. No one is
willing to take risks. No one is willing to be wrong.

Toxic cultures start with one simple dynamic: people fear looking stupid more 
than they desire finding truth. 

We've all been there at some point.
