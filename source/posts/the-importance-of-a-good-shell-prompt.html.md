A lot of developers choose to avoid the often big, clumsy and complicated
IDEs in favor of the Linux command line. At first sight the command line
is inferior to the experience you get from a full blown IDE. However, the
beauty of the command line is just that. It is fast, simple, and by default
it comes with very small set of pre-installed features.

To make the best use of the command line, you will have to invest your time to
learn and configure the various parts of the system. At first, this time
investment will slow you down, but with time, your investment will reward you
development workflow exponentially.

In case you are unfamiliar with the term 'prompt', it is the text that appears
every time you want to enter a new command in your shell.
