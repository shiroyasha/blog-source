[A Serious Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1019452/) is probably one of my all
time favorite movies. The protagonist, a simple physics professor, with a
simple, happy life, is suddenly hit by a streak of miss fortunate events. His
wife leaves him for another man, while he is forced out of his own house. He is
blackmailed at work.

He is a good man, and he considers himself a serious, but kind person. Every
issue he faces is not a life-or-death situation, but rather, a calm storm that
eats away his soul. The kind of issue, when you can't just pick up a weapon and
fight your issues like in an action movie.

While he watches his life unravel over multiple sudden incidents, he tries to
seek meaning and answers amidst his turmoils. He keeps repeating that he didn't
do anything to deserve this, failing to realize that in fact his inaction is
the reason for his fall.

## Sometimes life wants to slap you in the face

This year, in a sense, presented a similar challenge for me too. Nothing that
happened, wasn't a major issue, but my general life happiness decreased
significantly.

I started this year by splitting up with my long time girlfriend, which left me
in a state of numbness. In a state when the only thing you want to do is to
scream at life and solve your issue by punching walls as hard as you can. I even
hooked up with another girl, just to numb the pain, a decision which
probably made the situation even worse.

This was followed by the fact that the person who made me join my current
workplace, a man I loved and respected immensely, left the company.

Financially, I was still struggling to pay back my student loans, which were
keeping me in a constant state of anxiety.

The worst thing was probably the fact that I was still overweight, unfit, with
bad eating habits.

## Being a professional

As a kind of a grown up person, you can't let your emotions hit the surface.
Even if the only thing you want is to intoxicate yourself, cry, and generally be
angry, you have a responsibility to keep a straight face for your friends and
colleagues.

Every person has some kind of a struggle, you won't help them if you just hit
them with your own issue. On the other side, however, it is harder to heal your
own wounds if you don't let the world know that.

## Dipping your feet in the ocean

My anxiety was worsening every day. It was too hard for me to just relax and
enjoy life, even if I deep down knew that 'letting go' is probably the only real
cure.

Luckily for me, I was invited to give a speech in Porto, Portugal. I wasn't
expecting anything big from the trip. Even the weather was against me, as it was
raining every day while I was there.

I wasn't going to let the bad whether stop me from taking a walk through the
city. I bought a cheap umbrella, and I started walking toward the ocean. This
would be the first time for me to see the Atlantic ocean. I was a bit thrilled
by this fact.

I was 2 hours away from the beach. The only thing I was wearing was a
thin shirt, and a flip-flop on my feat. Needless to say, I was totally wet when
I arrived. But it was all worth it. The endless water, was breathtaking. The
wind was creating these giant waves that were hitting a stone on the beach with
immense force.

I felt small. It was a good feeling. The vastness of the ocean made me lose
focus, and I was just glaring at the endless nothing.

I decided to take down my flip-flops, roll up my trousers and jump in the water.
Fu$!##!$$kkk. It was cold as hell.

## Happiness

For some weird reason, that moment changed everything. It felt like a giant rock
fell of my back, and I was free to enjoy life, again. This was around two months
from today, but I am still happy, calm, and wear a genuine smile every day.

It is still super weird how easy was for me to get depressed, angry, anxious
and pissed of at life. It is even weirded that I only needed to jump into cold
water at the other side of Europe for it to all go away.

At the end of the day, the only real advice I can give my future self, comes
from Rocky:

> It ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep
> moving forward. That’s how winning is done!

## Final words

This was a bit different post from the others. I hope you enjoyed it.

Stay awesome!
